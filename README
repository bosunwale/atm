This is a challenge i gave to myself to test my knowledge in Java
The challenge was to create an Atm Porgram. Below are list of things the program can do
User has a default pin
If user enters wrong pin, there's a 3 times trial to input right pin else, account is locked and program terminates
User can deposit, withdraw, and check balance
There is a limit to how much user can deposit and withdraw
It is dynamic in the sense that each deposit is added to the previous deposit. The same goes for withdrawal
Any trasaction performed by user is reflected in the balance option i.e a user deposits 40000 and withdraws 600. When user checks balance, 34000 is displayed to user
